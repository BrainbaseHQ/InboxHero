(  )
       Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health
conditions in the United States—approximately 18% of all American
adults suffer from them—and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is
the most common among them.

However, people who actually meet the diagnostic criteria for
OCD are frequently misdiagnosed with GAD. That's why it's so
important to understand the distinction between GAD and OCD.

The good news is that a therapist with specialty training in OCD
can help you understand whether you're struggling with OCD, GAD,
or both, to help you get the most beneficial care for you. And by
learning to recognize the cycle of obsessions and compulsions in
OCD, you can ensure that you find the most effective treatment,
no matter what condition you have.

Read more about what GAD and OCD look like, and why it's so
important to receive the correct diagnosis.

"Medium" <hello@medium.com> - [Image "Header+-+Vice.png"] New media sites are like London buses. You wait ages for one to come along, and then two get cancelled at once. 
 Last week I was writing about BuzzFeed News and how, even after changing so many of the default assumptions of modern journalism, the model they pioneered appears to be on the edge of ruin. This week it’s the turn of Vice Media, the America-Canadian lifestyle, culture and politics magazine-turned-website that will long be held up as a pillar of hipster culture. The New York Times reported last week that the company — once valued at $5.7bn after investments from Disney and Rupert Murdoch — was on the brink of bankruptcy. 
 I’m not going to leave myself a hostage to fortune on the outcome of Vice’s current travails. The cultural penetration of the Vice name has been on the wane for several years, and the origins of the brand have been mired in controversy. Instead, I want to talk a little about what Vice is, was, and what the future for alt-media looks like. 
 Vice was, in fact, pretty much the first publication that ever hired me to write for them (excepting the Oxford Times, where I had a column for my final year at university). They paid me real money when I was a 21-year-old know-nothing aspirant hack, and at a rate of something like 30p a word (I’ve not been offered many more lucrative freelance deals). The first piece I ever wrote for them was a love letter to London’s Trocadero, a rundown arcade in the West End which is now a boutique cinema and retail complex. It’s still one of my favourite pieces I’ve ever written. Over the next couple of years, I wrote an array of features for Vice, covering topics ranging from homelessness to Scientology, child geniuses to air pollution. 
 I remember (though I can’t find the exact quote) that one of the first edits that happened to my copy at Vice was changing “backpacked German tourists” to “backpacked German dickheads”. Of all the places that I’ve written for, Vice comes the closest to speaking with a single voice. They certainly had the power to create star columnists like Clive Martin and Joel Golby, but there was still a baked-in form of witty cynicism. They liked to say things that wouldn’t be printed in the mainstream press, and they liked them to be spoken with the singular Great Vice Voice. 
 The story of Vice, the trajectory that the brand has been on, has basically been the story of cool. In the idea of cool, indeed in its very nature, is the idea of impermanence. Cool is not presupposed or inherited; it’s earned. Things must become cool. Stasis is fundamentally uncool, only change can generate new trends, new preferences, new fashions.
